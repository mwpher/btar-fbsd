btar-fbsd
=========

The original btar program is created and owned by Llu√≠s Batlle i Rossell, and
licensed under the GPLv3 (which you can find in ./LICENSE.GPLv3, as well as the
original tarball). I'm just a mediocre script kiddie who's trying to
make a version of btar that I can submit to the FreeBSD ports tree. (with the
author's permission, of course.)
